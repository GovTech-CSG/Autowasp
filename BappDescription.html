<p>Autowasp, a Burp Suite extension that integrates Burp issues logging, with OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG), to provide a streamlined web security testing flow for the modern-day penetration tester! This tool will guide new penetration testers to understand the best practices of web application security and automate OWASP WSTG checks. </p>

<p>Currently, Autowasp supports the following functionalities:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Testing checklist provided by OWASP WSTG</li>
	<li>Logger tool giving penetration testers the ability to extract and consolidate Burp Scanner issues and Proxy/Repeater/Intruder logs.</li>
	<li>Map flagged issues to checklist and generate into excel file</li>
</ul>
